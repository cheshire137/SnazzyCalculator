# Snazzy Calculator

This is intended to be a simple calculator written using GTK#, for the purpose of experimenting with GTK# and MonoDevelop.  I release all its source code under the [GPL v3 license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).  Many thanks to Eric White for his [tutorial on building a recursive descent parser in C#](http://ericwhite.com/blog/map/recursive-descent-parser/).
